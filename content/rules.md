## Rules

### Rules for you

- **Respect privacy**. Don't attempt to gain access to any person's account or data. If you think you've found any account info or personal data, **stop immediately** and submit a report.
- Only test for vulnerabilities in sites [explicitly listed in the scope below](#scope). **This is not an 18F-, GSA-, or government-wide bounty**; testing against sites not explicitly in scope isn't OK.
- **Don't disclose issues publically until we give you permission.** You automatically have permission to disclose after we notify you that we've fixed the issue, or after 90 days have passed.
- **Don't use scanners or automated tools to find vulnerabilities.** We may block your IP address(es) if you do, and vulnerabilities found with automated scanners aren't eligable for rewards.
- DDoS and spam attacks are not allowed.
- Non-technical attacks such as social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks on our offices or infrastructure aren't allowed.
- You must **follow [18F's code of conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)** when interacting with us or other bounty participants.
- You aren't eligible for rewards if you're a resident of a country against which the United States has trade restrictions or export sanctions. 
- If you're under 13, we can't pay you directly; you'll need to claim your bounties through a parent or legal guardian.

### Rules for us

- We will respond as quickly as possible to your submission. You should expect a response within one week of your submission (and often sooner).
- We will keep you updated as we work to fix the bug you submitted. 
- We will fix reported issues within 90 days (and typically much faster). If we can't, we'll give you permission to go public after 90 days.
- We will not take legal action against you if you play by the rules.

If you have any questions about the rules, [email us](mailto:fixme@example.com) and we'll help you sort it out!
