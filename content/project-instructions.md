## Instructions for Projects

So, you want your project included in the bug bounty? **Hooray!** Here's how to get involved.

In a nutshell, the requirement comes down to this: **you need to take accountability for fixing any reported issues in a reasonable time.** 18F's bug bounty team is more than happ to provide advice, guidance, and even help resolving issues. However, we won't play "cops" -- you need to be OK owning the responsibility of tracking and resolving issues.

### Management tasks

You'll need to take care of a few management tasks while participating in the bounty:

- **Triage**: as new issues are reported, you'll need to review the submissions to determine which are legitimate (and which need more info from the reporter, are invalid or duplicates, etc). You should try to triage new issues within a week at most (and, preferably, daily).
- **Tracking**: once issues are confirmed and accepted for a fix, you'll need to track them to their conclusion, and make sure they don't get lost. This is especially important for lower-severity issues: it's common for them to continually get de-prioritized and hence never get fixed. We're committing to a 90-day SLA ([see below for more details](#sla)), so you'll need to keep an eye on that.
- **Communication**: communicate updates to reporters with open issues. Usually this'll just be "thanks we got it, expect a fix $whenever" at the beginning, and then "ok it's fixed!" at the end. But, if something changes during the time the issue is open, you should communicate that to the reporter.

Generally, we think you should expect to spend on the order of 4-8 hours a week on bounty management tasks. If you're spending appreciably more, please contact the bounty team and let us know; that might indicate that somethings wrong.

Time tracking: time spent on these management tasks should be Tocked as `FIXME / Bug Bounty`, but time spent on actually resolving the issues should be Tocked to the project itself.

### SLAs

We have one Big Formal SLA: **we've committed to resolve reported issues within 90 days**. 

*[Note that "resolve" doesn't always have to mean "fix"; it's completely OK to decide that an issue is too low-risk to actually fix. So in that case "resolve" would just mean "pay the reporter, but tell them we don't necessarily plan to fix within 90 days."]*

We'll notify you about open issues on every half-life (i.e. Day 45, 22, 11, 5, 3, 2, and 1) to help you track issues as they get closer to their deadline.

However, we *suggest* you aim to hit these informal SLAs based on the issue's risk:

* Tier 1: 1 week
* Tier 2: 30 days
* Tier 3: 60 days
