# Selection Process

This document outlines how the bug bounty team decides how to fill an empty slot
(we currently have five). It's descriptive rather than proscriptive; that is,
at the moment it simply describes what we've been doing. It may not be what
we do long-term.

## Reserved slots

We reserved two slots for cloud.gov and login.gov, as our highest-risk
[[1]](#fn1) and highest impact [[2]](#fn2) projects. Those projects get a
right of first refusal for their slots. It's not guaranteed: both the project
and bounty teams will need to be comfortable before those bounties are made
operational.

## Other slots

Here's what we did to fill the other slots:

- Opened up a call for interested programs, asking them to read the project
  instructions and apply by speaking to us in Slack if interested.

- We made a decision to review programs on a rolling basis, rather than wait for
  some deadline and stack-rank. This optimizes for speed of getting a program
  operational, but risks of prioritizing based on speed, not impact. We're
  comfortable with this risk.

- We reviewed programs as they came in, looking for the criteria listed in
  the program rules, and particularly with an eye towards projects that are:

  - Fairly mature, longer-running
  - Fully-staffed, with committed engineers who can fix issues as they're
    reported.
  - Clear and committed project managers/leads who we trust to prioritize
    security issues appropriately.
  - Programs that are relatively mature according the Hacker One's maturity
    model (looking for roughly "medium" or better in most categories).

- Submitted those programs to an informal call for consensus among the bug
  bounty team and primary stakeholders.

[This is where we are today; next steps TBDocumented.]

[1] We don't have a formal way of defining "risk" or "highest"; this was simply
a "gut feel" decision.
